# Project Blueprint: Modern Document Editor

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern, web-based document editor that combines the best features of Google Docs and Microsoft Word. The editor will be designed for both desktop and mobile use, offering a seamless and intuitive experience across all devices.

## Core Features

*   **Rich Text Editor:** A robust `contenteditable`-based editor that supports a wide range of formatting options:
    *   Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough
    *   Font Family and Font Size selection
    *   Text Color and Highlight Color
    *   Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
    *   Unordered and Ordered Lists
    *   Text Alignment (Left, Center, Right, Justify)
    *   Image insertion and resizing
    *   Tables
    *   Hyperlinks
*   **Modern UI/UX:**
    *   A clean, intuitive, and familiar interface.
    *   Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
    *   A professional and polished look and feel, with a focus on readability and ease of use.
*   **Additional Features:**
    *   Word/character count.
    *   Save/load documents (initially to local storage, potentially to the cloud later).
    *   Print functionality.

## Plan for Current Request

1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Reflect the new project direction.
2.  **Update HTML Structure (`index.html`):**
    *   Create a more traditional document editor layout with a prominent toolbar (ribbon) at the top.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive using meta tags and flexible containers.
3.  **Update CSS Styling (`style.css`):**
    *   Redesign the UI to be clean and professional, inspired by modern document editors.
    *   Implement responsive styles using media queries to ensure a good experience on mobile and desktop.
    *   Style the toolbar and its controls.
4.  **Update JavaScript Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement the functionality for the new toolbar controls.
    *   Focus on the core text formatting features first.
    *   Remove the AI assistant panel and related logic.
